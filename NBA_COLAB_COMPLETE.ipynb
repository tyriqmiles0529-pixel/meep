    "- Then re-run from Step 1\n",

    "## 🎯 Why This Works Better Than Local Training:\n",

    "1. **GPU Acceleration**: 5-10x faster than CPU\n",
    "2. **More RAM**: 12GB+ vs your laptop's limits\n",
    "3. **No System Slowdown**: Your computer stays responsive\n",

    "2. **LightGBM** (using raw + deep features)\n",
    "3. **Sigma Model** (uncertainty quantification)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Pipeline:\n",
    "- **Phase 1-5**: Basic stats + rolling averages + team context\n",
    "- **Phase 6**: Optimization (momentum, consistency, fatigue)\n",
    "- **Phase 7**: Situational (schedule density, opponent history)\n",
    "- **Basketball Reference Priors**: Historical statistical context\n",
